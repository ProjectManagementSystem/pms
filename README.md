This Project Management System(PMS) is yet unnamed.
--
Our open-source work has a different approach to project management systems. I won't tell you how yet.

-initialize.py and initialize.sql are used for creating MySQL database. They are found in the root directory of project.

-Files in server.py are the server side codes. We're using mainly python language, and Flask Framework.

-Files in client-mobile/Android are the Android mobile client source codes. They are at login and registertion step now. We are supporting at least 3.xx SDK of Android and targeting 4.4x SDK now. Production IDLEs are both Eclipse & Android Studio. 

Please see the wiki page at the right menu for our layers, functions and any details. If there's something you know and it's not on the wiki, we'd appreciate if you add it.
